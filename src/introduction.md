# Welcome! #

# RailsBridge Workshop: HTML & CSS

# What is RailsBridge? #

Railsbridge is an outreach program consisting of many members of the community
surrounding the Ruby programming language.

The primary focus right now is breaking down barriers that prevent people from
learning programming or becoming involved in the programming community.

# What Does RailsBridge Do? #

The RailsBridge community has been working hard to put together monthly
workshops aimed at getting more women involved in software development and
computer science.

You should totally come to the next one! It will be in March!

# Today's Workshop #

# Pulling the Rails out of RailsBridge
<img width="150" src="rails_logo.jpg">
RailsBridge normally teaches web application development using Ruby on Rails.

### Rails is... ###
<ul>
  <li class="slide">Designed to help you build an application without needing to
know how the plumbing works</li>
  <li class="slide">Used to build applications that run in the browser, but that
doesn't mean you can't make them just for you.</li>
  <li class="slide"><em>not</em> a programming language</li>
  <li class="slide">(perhaps you're thinking of Ruby)</li>
</ul>

# In Order to Focus On #

# HTML #
__H__yper-__t__ext __M__arkup __L__anguage

<div class="slide">
  <p><strong>H</strong>yper-<strong>t</strong>ext</p>
  <p>This term comes from the fact that early computers could only work with
plain text files. Computer users as early as the 1960s wanted to enrich this
text and make it easier to work with. Thus, hypertext was born. It is text
because the file is stored as plain text, yet hyper because the text has a
special meaning beyond the plain text when interpreted by a special program. For
HTML, that special program is your web browser.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <p><strong>M</strong>arkup</p>
  <p>Being a markup language means that HTML is mixed in with plain content
text. Think of a time when you turned in an essay to your teacher. Your teacher
reads your essay and marks it up with comments or suggestions.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <p><strong>L</strong>anguage</p>
  <p>People use different languages for different types of communication. We use
languages such as English or Mandarin for human communication or languages such
as Ruby or Java to give instructions to computers. HTML is a special language
for describing documents.</p>
</div>

# CSS

__C__ascading __S__tyle __S__heets

<div class="slide">
  <p><strong>C</strong>ascading</p>
  <p>You inherit aspects of your appearance from your parents. So do HTML
elements! We call this inheritance "cascading" because the properties cascade
from outer elements to inner.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <p><strong>S</strong>tyle</p>
  <p>CSS only affects the visual aspects of an HTML page, it can't change
the content. So it allows you to specify different visual properties for your
content.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <p><strong>S</strong>heets</p>
  <p>Because CSS doesn't change the document structure, you could apply any
multitude of CSS files to a single html page. Think of CSS as the clothes the
html is wearing. You or I can change clothes without becoming new people</p>
</div>

# Goals for the Day #

<ul>
  <li class="slide">Meet some new friends!</li>
  <li class="slide">Learn about the languages that power most of the web.</li>
  <li class="slide">Have so much fun you'll come to another Railsbridge!</li>
</ul>
